## 3D-Model-to-Pdf-Conversion

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Project Dependencies

* Install Autodesk DWG True Viewer 2016 for Windows
* Copy Scrits folder into some drive
* Generate a csv file containing all dwg file names with path
* Build and run the converter supplying full path of csv file
